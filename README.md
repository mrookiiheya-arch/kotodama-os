Exploring conversational AI and behavior design.

---

## What is this?

Kotodama OS is an experimental concept for designing conversational AI
that focuses not only on responses, but on **behavior, continuity, and interaction flow**.

This project explores:
- How an AI maintains consistency across conversations
- How behavior can be designed, not just generated
- How dialogue can feel intentional rather than reactive

This repository currently serves as a conceptual and experimental space.

This project is currently documentation-first and concept-driven.
Implementation may follow based on feedback and interest.

## Why this exists

Most AI systems focus on:
- Accuracy
- Speed
- Output quality

Kotodama OS focuses on:
- Behavioral consistency
- Conversational presence
- Long-term interaction design

It is not a framework or SDK yet — this is an exploration of ideas,
design patterns, and possible future implementations.

## Status

- Concept stage

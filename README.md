# Kotodama OS  
**External "Behavior OS" Layer for LLMs — Solving Persona Drift and Long-term Consistency**

---

## 🚀 The Core Achievement

Kotodama OS is an architectural layer designed to provide **behavioral consistency** and **intentional interaction control** for Large Language Models (LLMs).

Unlike traditional approaches that rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning,  
Kotodama OS introduces a **non-reflexive deliberation layer** that operates externally to the model, enabling stable behavior across long-term interactions.

- **No Retraining Required:** Works as a model-agnostic external layer  
- **Reduces Persona Drift:** Maintains values, tone, and decision tendencies across extended conversations  
- **Intentional Design:** Moves beyond reactive text generation toward structured conversational behavior

## 🎥 Demos (Core Behavior Implementation)

These videos demonstrate the Kotodama OS concept applied to a conversational agent, focusing on **behavioral stability rather than raw model capability**.

**Demo #01 — Multi-Persona Reasoning (k / hoto / ame / bis)**

**Demo #02 — Continuity Across Sessions (Context Carryover & Daily-Life Reasoning)**

**Demo #03 — Structured Reasoning Inside Natural Conversation (Work / Planning / Decision-Making)**

*(Audio is in Japanese. The focus is on structural consistency of behavior and interaction flow over time.)*

## 🧠 Architectural Concept

Kotodama OS introduces a proprietary **Deliberation Gate** and **Pulse Engine** to control cognitive flow:


Observation → Imagination → Selection → Expression



By decoupling internal reasoning from output generation,  
the system avoids purely reactive responses and maintains continuity of behavior.

This allows the AI to preserve interaction style and decision tendencies across sessions  
without modifying model weights.

## 📌 Current Status & Business Inquiries

This project is currently in the **Concept & Architecture** stage.

The core behavioral logic and implementation details are proprietary and not publicly released.

Kotodama OS is being developed as a foundational layer for:

- Companion AI  
- Long-term conversational agents  
- Wearable / always-on AI systems  
- Social or relationship-oriented AI products  

We are currently open to:

- Research collaboration  
- Technical discussion  
- Strategic partnerships  
- Product integration opportunities

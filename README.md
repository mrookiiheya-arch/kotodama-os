# Kotodama OS

**External "Behavior OS" layer for LLMs: Solving Persona Drift and Long-term Consistency.**

---

## 🚀 The Core Achievement
Kotodama OS is an architectural layer designed to provide **behavioral consistency** and **intentionality** to Large Language Models (LLMs) like Llama 3 and GPT-4. 

Unlike traditional methods that rely on prompt engineering or fine-tuning, Kotodama OS implements a **non-reflexive deliberation engine** that sits on top of the model to ensure a stable persona over long-horizon interactions.

- **No Retraining Required:** Works as a model-agnostic external layer.
- **Prevents Persona Drift:** Maintains values, tone, and decision logic even in complex, multi-day conversations.
- **Intentional Design:** Moves beyond reactive text generation to goal-oriented conversational behavior.

## 🎥 Demos (Core Behavior Implementation)

These videos demonstrate the "Kotodama OS" logic applied to a conversational agent, achieving a level of presence and consistency that raw LLMs cannot maintain.

*(Audio is in Japanese, but the focus is on the structural consistency of the AI's internal logic and behavior over time.)*

## 🛠 Architectural Concept
Kotodama OS introduces a proprietary **"Deliberation Gate"** and **"Pulse Engine"** to control the cognitive flow:

`Observation` → `Imagination` → `Selection` → `Expression`

By decoupling "thought" from "output tokens," we enable the AI to have a persistent "will" that guides its personality across sessions.

## 📝 Current Status & Business Inquiries
This project is currently in the **Concept & Architecture** stage. The core engine and implementation logic are private assets. 

**I am looking for strategic partnerships or acquisition opportunities** to integrate this behavior design layer into next-generation AI products (e.g., Personal AI, Wearables, Social Robots).

- **Contact:** Please reach out via GitHub Issues or LinkedIn for technical documentation and business inquiries.
